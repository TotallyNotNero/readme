# Who am I?
TotallyNotNero is obviously a screen name... right? Well, I am a developer who specializes in iOS Development and Jailbreaking. I am fluent in C and Swift, and proficient in Java and JavaScript. I am a car enthusiast, owning a Chevy Camaro. I am a basketball enthusiast, as I play and watch it a hell of a lot, and a gaming enthusiast, playing Rainbow Six Siege and Watch Dogs. I also watch a lot of NCIS, Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, Magnum P.I, and Scorpion (bring it back please?). I am also a leftist.

I have a lot of experience with the Apple Kernel, as well as a decent amount with developing Discord bots. You could probably say that I am self taught at destruction.

Contact me through Twitter, Discord, or my blog!
