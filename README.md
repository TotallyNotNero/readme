# Who am I?
TotallyNotNero is obviously a screen name... right? Well, I am a developer who specializes in iOS development and jailbreaking. I am extremely interested in the low-level components that power today's iPhones and other iOS devices. I work tirelessly on finding software and hardware bugs, knowing someday one of the bugs I find will be of help to someone. I am fluent in C and Swift, and proficient in Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I am a car enthusiast. I am a basketball enthusiast. I am also a gaming enthusiast, playing Rainbow Six Siege and Watch Dogs. I also watch a lot of NCIS, Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, Magnum P.I, Manifest and Scorpion (bring it back please?). I am also a leftist.

I have been developing since 2016, learning multiple languages and skills that help me today. I have made various projects in JavaScript since then and even more in C and Swift.

I am a part of Storm Developmentz, a development group focused on providing high-quality discord bots and the most upmost professionalism with support.
Our first public bot is StormBeatz, a high-quality and top notch music bot capable of providing a seamless music listening experience. With 80,000+ servers and growing, we are the best in the business with our capabilities offered. Check it out someday - you will not be dissatisfied.

I can interact with multiple APIs, such as Discord, Spotify, and YouTube - using both JavaScript and Swift. I also have experience in setting up and utilizing databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite.

I have ample experience using multiple Discord libraries - Discord.JS is used by me the most, followed by SwiftDiscord.

I am a modding enthusiast. I have modified many devices I own, from my Nintendo Switch to VR devices and my graphing calculator, back to my Android devices and... a car.
My modification journeys are usually throughly documented on my [blog](https://blog.etronicindustries.org/), if you would like to learn more.

I have a lot of experience with the Apple Kernel, as well as developing Discord bots. You could probably say that I am self taught at destruction.

# Projects

Currently, I have a few projects in the works:

--> **Storm Developmentz Developer**

I am a developer for Storm Developmentz, a group of developers who focus on providing high quality, customizable, efficient, and reliable Discord bots. Our first public project is StormBeatz, the best music bot for Discord. With over 80,000 servers and a 99.9% uptime, this bot can suit your music craving needs!

--> **CarLink**

CarLink is a platform designed specifically for Stellantis vehicles equipped with Uconnect and Remote Start/Stop technology as a replacement for Uconnect Access, which is installed by default in Stellantis vehicles for model years 2014 and newer. CarLink allows you to remotely lock/unlock, start/stop the engine, roll windows down, monitor car vitals (battery, engine, etc), and work as vehicle security - all from the comfort of your phone. CarLink is in early development, however on launch, will support 2012+ Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, and RAM cars with remote start/stop + push button technology.

--> **SwiftyBot**

Currently, SwiftyBot is a Discord bot programmed in Swift utilizing the SwiftDiscord library. It is the first Swift discord bot - to my knowledge - supporting a command handler, event handler and music handler, all in the same bot! This bot is in alpha and private for now, however will later sport many amazing features and commands.

--> **SwiftyLink**

SwiftyLink is a Lavalink client written in Swift. It is designed for use in Discord bots utilizing Swift Discord clients (e.g. SwiftDiscord). It allows for unbridled access to everything Lavalink has to offer, including loading and playing tracks, without ever reaching your physical bot's voice connection.

--> **HotBot**

I am a Project Manager/developer for HotBot, the most advanced discord moderation bot in its class, with many features such as first class moderation and automod features, an advanced filter, and more! Closed Source and available only in BACON ARMY.

--> **Administrator for BACON ARMY**

I am a retired Head Administrator, current Administrator for BACON ARMY, a YouTuber's discord server.

I am a discord moderator for Jailbreak, a roblox game created by badimo.

All in one tool for jailbroken and non-jailbroken A7 devices. Development on hold for now.
